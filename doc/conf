#when you make the bot, remove these #lines :)
#These lines MUST be correctly syntaxed or the bot will not work properly.
#A conf can be only a hub conf or only a leaf conf. (see README for locations)
#The first line must contain UID (use "id" in shell to get uid)
#- 1113
#The second must be the output from uname -nv (-nr on FBSD)

#any lines after should be in this format:
#botnick [!]ip4 [+]hostname (the + means ipv6) (the ! means internal NAT ip address, IE: 10.10.0.3, Hostname REQUIRED)
#Full example:
