Wraith botpack by lordares, with credits and thanks to the following:
(written from a base of Eggdrop 1.6.12)

* Eggdrop team for developing such a great bot to code off of.
* Einride and ievil for taking eggdrop1.4.3 and making their very effecient botpack Ghost.
* ryguy for beta testing, providing code, finding bugs, and providing input.
* SFC for providing compile shells, continuous input, feature suggestions, and testing.
* xmage for beta testing.
* passwd for beta testing, and his dedication to finding bugs.
* pgpkeys for finding bugs, and providing input.
* qFox for providing an mIRC $md5() alias, not requiring a dll or >6.03
* Sith_Lord helping test ipv6 on the bot (admin@elitepackets.com)
* Excelsior for finding a bug on BSD with the ipv6, and for celdrop which inspired many features.
* syt for giving me inspiration to code a more secure bot.
* Blackjac for helping with the bx auth script with his Sentinel script.
* Mystikal for various bugs

The following botpacks gave me inspiration and ideas (no code):
* awptic by lordoptic
* optikz by ryguy and lordoptic
* celdrop by excelsior
* genocide by Crazi, Dor, psychoid, and Ace24
* tfbot by warknite and loslinux
