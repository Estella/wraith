Channel modes:
	Read eggdrop docs.
	Additions:
	+/-fastop, -fastop does cookieops
	+voice voices all except +q users and people that > m|+m devoice
	+closed is like ghost's +locked (kicks all non-users and keeps +i set)
        +nomop Kicks users who set +ooo*
	Anything not listed here or in eggdrop docs is not finished.

Warnings:
	Do not set a channel +voice, and then op a bot that is not linked to the wraith botnet.
	  This will cause some serious bot fights.



Memorize these:
To see what commands they give access to:
  See http://www.shatow.net/vb/showthread.php?s=&threadid=33
(that may be old, but the general idea is there)

Only +a can give certain flags, I forget which ones, but you'll figure that out ;)

   Global  Chan    Does
   --------------------------------------------------
   a               administrator
   b               bot
   c               leaf chat hub (leaf that accepts /dcc chat or /ctcp chat)
                   There is no limit to chat hubs, set all leafs +c if you want.
                   Better idea to just set a few leafs +c and tell your users.
   d       d       auto deop (never +o)
   e       e       exempt from stopnethack //useless
   i               hub access
   j               leaf chat hub access
   k       k       autokick (never on chan)
   l       l       bot sets limit
