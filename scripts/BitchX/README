wraith bx auth script 1.0

This script is lame.

It will improve over time to be as effecient as the mIRC script.


Compile the md5 binary and place: $HOME/.BitchX/md5
Edit the wraith.bx file and change the path near the top.

To load: /load /path/to/w.bx

You will have to /setauth pass secpass authkey, everytime you load the script, I will fix this in future versions.

to auth over IRC:
/msg bot auth?
They will reply with "auth. botname"
then:
/msg bot auth yourpass
then it will msg back that +Auth line, the script takes it from here.

DCC chat is similar, enter pass, then +Auth is sent and script takes over.

Send all improvements to lordares, thanks.
